# Prosthetic Hand with Gesture Control

An EMG and OpenCV-based prosthetic hand system designed to interpret muscle signals for intuitive and natural gesture control.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a low-cost prosthetic hand capable of responding to human muscle signals.  
EMG signals are captured, processed, and translated into finger movements using an embedded controller.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. EMG sensors capture muscle activity  
2. Signals are processed using Python and OpenCV  
3. Arduino controls servo motors for finger movement  
4. Grip strength is adjusted dynamically based on signal intensity
